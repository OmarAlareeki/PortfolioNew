  <p class="intro"><span id="m">I</span>nteracting with society and have respect to everyone ease many obstacles. It builds stronger relations with others. For so many years, I found respect is a strong key for a bigger society interation. It helps understanding each other along with the mission assigned in life. I believe that the more respect you give people, the more doors will open in front of you. So think of it as a key to succeed and then you will.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Always have respect for others' views and opinions.</li>
    <p class="explain">Many times, we all as a society might have different views and ideas, however; listening to the other side opinions and ideas is a key for good conversations between individuals in society. I found that being open to accept is an essential concept of dealing with each other in life.</p>

    <li>Never underestimate someone's work.</li>
    <p class="explain">Give the real value of effort and time for those who work with you as a co-worker. If you need to cleafy some pionts, it is ok. But never underestimate co-worker's effort because you might be in the same shoes one day and no one knows how much you have accomplished but they do not recognize it.</p>

    <li>Listen until others finish</li>
    <p class="explain">Do not interapt others when they are talking. Many people miss the point of what others say or talk because we do not pay attention and tend to interapt before getting the idea of what is the individual in front of you saying. Try to conclude some points of what is he or she trying to inform you.</p>

    <li>Bring your ideas to the table.</li>
    <p class="explain">Be happy to share your ideas and thoughts if you are in work environment or at school. Try to explain your ideas and yourself in the best way you can. I tend to think of what is my idea in my head before saying it. The reason is I always try to explain myself in a good way that everyone hears can absorb and understand clearly.</p>

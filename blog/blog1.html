  <p class="intro"><span id="m">H</span>ow many times you have felt you failed in front of a goal you want to achieve ? I guess anyone can fail or I should say everyone will have the obstacle of failing. But how much of indurance and patience we have when we fail and want to get back to the powerful lane. Or our patience and indurance can not take so much pressure, therefore, why bother to stand up in front of this obstacle. </p>

    <li>Waiting for the chaning point of life is unbearable.</li>
    <p class="explain">After finishing school, I felt like I am done and now I can go to work in a place that I like. However, it is not easy just to aim without work. It actually one of the hardest time to apply for a job after school. It needs many factors to make it work fast. Patience is a key in this case. Many individuals do not have patience enough to wait and apply to different jobs to land first job. Others, successful ones, look at factors and work on them. When someone is in the ground level, it requires to give work more time and effort in order to reach the goal that you have in mind.</p>

    <li>Check what is missing.</li>
    <p class="explain">Look at your projects and other materials and compare them with someone's material. As a developer, try to make comparison between your work and other's work. From there, you can decide what is missing in your materials and what is needed to be fixed or added. Check your portfolio and resume which are your start key of searching for a job. Do both of them look professional as enough as the others. Look at what is needed to be added and updated. From there, you could say you have steped on you first step in the road of job opportunities.</p>

    <li>Read whenever you have time.</li>
    <p class="explain"> Always try to have a positive feel toward learning and adding more to your bank of knowledge. Being in the tech industury is kind of required to be updated with the new tools and technologies. Reading at least for an hour everyday is a gate that will introduce you to so much more info and more.</p>

    <li>Stay always encouraged.</li>
    <p class="explain"> " Fail Fast. In coding (and in life), I want to know at the earliest possible point that something is broken or not working, rather than let it sit and propagate further. Go all in, fail quickly, fix what is broken, and keep on keeping on," - Stephanie Volftsun, cofounder and CTO at Knotch. Programming requires attention to all steps and moves you do to your code. Sometimes, you might stay on one problem the whole day and you have not figured out the issue in your code. Staying encouraged always helps to finish what you have and never feel there is something impossible.</p>

    <li>Build connections </li>
    <p class="explain">Social media today plays an essentional part of our life as a representation of ourselves. Do you have social media references to show off who you are ? If you do not, you should start building your social media community before it is too late. Most jobs applied today requires some kind of source of info about who you are and what kind of a person you are. The life obstacle can be in this case is not being able to show off yourself in a relaible way. Being reliable and making sense to others can be challenging because everyone would have a different view of you.</p>
